Planetoid
=========

Planetoid is a roguelike built in Ruby. It's built on Hatchling, which is a roguelike library (and Ruby gem).

Hatchling provides some useful functionality:

- Uniform display for colour across platforms (Windows/Linux)
- Entity/component system
- Data-driven architecture

You can easily create your own roguelikes using Hatchling; Planetoid is the first such game.
